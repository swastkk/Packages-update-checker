# Packages-update-checker
This repo will have a project that will insure that the packages that are being used in the project are up to date or not, and if new release of a required package is there, it will notify prior breakage of the whole project working.

### 2. Secondly, will start the work on npm packages and [yarn](https://www.npmjs.com/package/) and [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/package)
